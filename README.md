# Project 501 / CafeApp.java

Working within project constraints to capture Consule input for a coffee store order.
Writes this order to a file to create a receipt and calcuates the subtotal and total. 
Its a bit weird because it was written in a single block without functions and then retrofitted to fit within a class requirement.

This could be better by using functions, making the class implementation better, using a gui program, using a better format to format the string to print to the file, using a simpler way to calculate the total and sanitizing the input.
